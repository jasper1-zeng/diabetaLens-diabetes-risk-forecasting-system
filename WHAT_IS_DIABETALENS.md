# 🩺 What is DiabetaLens?

## 🎯 **Core Purpose**
DiabetaLens is an **AI-powered diabetes risk forecasting system** that predicts your likelihood of developing diabetes over 1, 3, and 6-month periods using your personal health data and activity patterns.

---

## 🔍 **What It Does**

### **Input**: Your Health Information
- **Age and BMI**: Basic demographic and health metrics
- **Activity Data**: 28 days of daily step counts from smartwatch/fitness tracker
- **Health Context**: Integration with evidence-based diabetes statistics

### **Processing**: Advanced Analysis
- **Risk Algorithm**: Implements specified 5% baseline + 0.1% daily increment model
- **Machine Learning**: 88.2% accurate Random Forest classifier
- **Time Series Analysis**: Forecasts future activity patterns and trends
- **Data Validation**: Ensures accuracy and completeness of health data

### **Output**: Personalized Insights
- **Risk Predictions**: 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month diabetes risk percentages
- **AI Recommendations**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet generates personalized advice
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visual charts and actionable health guidance
- **Safety Information**: Medical disclaimers and healthcare provider recommendations

---

## 🧮 **How It Works**

### **The Algorithm** (Exact Case Study Implementation)
```
1. Start with 5% baseline diabetes risk (age-adjusted)
2. If age < 30: Use baseline only
3. If age ≥ 30 AND BMI indicates medium/high risk:
   - Count days with <5,000 steps in past 28 days
   - Add 0.1% risk for each sedentary day
4. Forecast future activity patterns
5. Calculate 1, 3, 6-month risk projections
```

### **The Technology**
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python with machine learning models
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript responsive web application
- **AI Integration**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet for health recommendations
- **Data Sources**: Smartwatch data + Australian Bureau of Statistics

## 📊 **Real-World Example**

### **Sample User Journey**
```
👤 User: 45-year-old, BMI 28.5, moderately active

📊 Input: 28 days of step data (avg 5,200 steps/day)

🧮 Processing: 
   - Age ≥ 30 ✓, BMI medium risk ✓
   - 12 sedentary days (<5000 steps) identified
   - Baseline: 5.2% + (12 × 0.1%) = 6.4% current risk

🔮 Forecasting:
   - 1-month: 6.8% (trend continues)
   - 3-month: 7.5% (seasonal adjustment)
   - 6-month: 8.3% (behavior consistency)

🤖 AI Recommendations:
   - Exercise: Increase to 7,000+ daily steps
   - Nutrition: Mediterranean diet principles
   - Monitoring: Weekly weight tracking
   - Timeline: Gradual 500-step weekly increases

📱 Output: Interactive dashboard with progress tracking
```
