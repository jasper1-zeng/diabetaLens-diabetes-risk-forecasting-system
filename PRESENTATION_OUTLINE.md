## 📋 **SLIDE 2: Case Study Background & Requirements**
```
Fictitious Scenario:

"Your baseline risk is 5% for developing diabetes in your lifetime. 
From the age of 30, this risk increases by 0.1% for every day in a 
month where their step count is less than 5,000 steps per day, and 
where they have a BMI result that puts them in a medium or high-risk 
category for developing diabetes."

Required Deliverables:
✅ Connect to health data sources (Apple Health, Google Fit, Kaggle)
✅ Develop algorithm for increasing diabetes risk
✅ Forecast risk for: 1 month, 3 months, 6 months
✅ Use historical and trend data from chosen device
✅ Present findings as visual representation
✅ Use LLM to provide commentary on the data set
✅ Explain model adaptation over time
✅ Address forecasting challenges across time horizons

Challenge: Create appropriate algorithm for diabetes risk forecasting

## 🧮 **SLIDE 7: Core Algorithm Development**
```
Exact Implementation of Specified Risk Model

Mathematical Model:
• Baseline: 5% lifetime risk (age-stratified using ABS 2022)
• Age threshold: 30 years (younger = baseline only)
• Risk increment: 0.1% per sedentary day (<5000 steps)
• BMI gating: Medium/high risk categories only

Multi-Horizon Forecasting:
• 1-month: Linear extrapolation (±5% confidence)
• 3-month: Exponential smoothing (±15% confidence)
• 6-month: ML prediction (±25% confidence)

Code Implementation:
def calculate_diabetes_risk(age, bmi, past_28_day_steps):
    baseline_risk = get_age_based_baseline(age)
    if age < 30: return baseline_risk
    sedentary_days = count_days_below_5000_steps()
    additional_risk = sedentary_days * 0.001
    return baseline_risk + additional_risk
```
