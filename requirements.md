# Data Analyst Engineer – Case Study

## Introduction

The purpose of this question is to test your technical, research, problem solving and critical thinking skills so that we can appropriately assess your ﬁt for this role. You will be asked to present both your ﬁndings and approach on Wednesday, 16 July. Should you have any questions between now and Wednesday, please feel free to email us directly.

Please note that the scenario provided below is completely made up, but designed to demonstrate your approach to creating ==an appropriate algorithm==.

## Case Study

Connect to a health data source, such as Apple Health Kit, Google Fit or Health Connect, and capture all available information.

You may also use the following data sets from Kaggle:

Smart watch health data https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammedarfathr/smartwatch-health-datauncleaned

Diabetes related information - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/smayanj/diabetesrisk-dataset

Here is a ﬁctitious scenario

Your baseline risk is 5% for developing diabetes in your lifetime. From the age of 30, this risk increases by 0.1% for every day in a month where their step count is less than 5,000 steps per day, and where they have a BMI result that puts them in a medium or high-risk category for developing diabetes. Develop an algorithm to forecast a person’s increasing risk of developing diabetes for the next month, next 3 months and next 6 months. Use the historical and trend data from your chosen device and other data that may be relevant.

Your presentation and approach must:

• Present the ﬁndings as a visual representation
• Explain the shortcomings/challenges of forecasting over the different time horizons
• Use an LLM to provide commentary on the data set
• Also explain how you would adjust the model over time?

As part of this test, we would also like you to present:

1. Describe what tools you have used
2. How you captured the information, cleaned and stored the data
3. Present the algorithm developed
4. Detail how, and the steps taken to integrate with an LLM of your choice, including the rationale
5. Present any additional changes or enhancements you would make for a project like this
